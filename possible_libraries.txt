This document lists libraries we might use.


Serialization / RPC:
	Java-specific:
		Kyro is pure serialization [http://code.google.com/p/kryo/]
		Standard Java RMI/serialization is slow and awkward.
		Hadoop RPC + serialization is faster
		Michael Armbrust's Scala-Avro plugin and scads message passing layer is useful if we opt for Avro + Scala.

	Cross-language:
		Avro serialization is mature, RPC is less so. Apache license (Permissive).
		Thrift.  Apache license (Permissive).
		Protobufs is just serialization but more mature. BSD license.
		


Networking:
	Twitter Finagle is a network stack for asynch RPC on the JVM.  Apache license (Permissive).
	Netty is the underlying layer


Threading:
	The disruptor threading library that Storm uses.
