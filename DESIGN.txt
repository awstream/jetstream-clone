This document describes the current vision for the high-level architecture of JetStream.

DEFINITIONS:

A query is a request by the user for a particular fact about a system. Queries are never standing. All query results must be present in some hypercube.

A computation is the process by which the system materializes data in hypercubes. A computation can be either standing or one-shot.

A task is the smallest unit of a computation that JetStream will explicitly place.

A source is a task that emits hypercubes.

An operator transforms one or more source hypercubes into a destination hypercube. Operators run on nodes.

A node is a computer on which JetStream can place sources or operators.



SEMANTICS:

JetStream exists to maintain views of changing data. Data will be structured as tables or hypercubes (THIS IS VAGUE SO FAR.)

Each hypercube exists on a particular node.

Nodes may periodically checkpoint the hypercubes. These can be stored on either local or shared storage.
