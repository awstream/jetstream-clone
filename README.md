JetStream
---

JetStream is a wide-area streaming analytical engine designed and implemented by Princeton researchers.

## Docker Image for Quick Start
https://hub.docker.com/r/nebgnahz/jetstream/

## API Documentations:

## Why clone, not fork?
This repository is a clone of [JetStream from Princeton](https://github.com/princeton-sns/jetstream/).
I cloned the whole codebase (including history) instead of forknig because Github doesn't index forked repositories.
All credits go to the original author of JetStream (which doesn't have an open-source license at this point).
