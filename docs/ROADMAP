Before we start coding:
	Need to fix terminology.
	Need to pick RPC framework. Probably Avro or Thrift?
	Need to specify a preliminary set of RPCs. Is scheduling push from the controller or pull via heartbeats?


Version 0.1:
	Must run some useful query on a cluster.
	Should run it quickly -- low start latency and decent performance
	Should have minimal code movement challenges

Data plane is probably C++ or Java -- C++ if Mike writes it, else Java
Control likely to be Scala -- especially if Ari writes it.

Control will be a single central server, presumably plus on-node coordinator.


Version 0.2:
	Should run in wide area. Should have nontrivial scheduler + query optimizer.


FUTURE:
	Fancypants scheduling and optimization?
	Decentralized control?
	Tracking of available resources
	Approximations
