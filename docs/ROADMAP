Data plane is probably C-ish C++.
Control plane for now is Python.

Control will be a single central server, presumably plus on-node coordinator.


Version 0.1:
	Must run some useful query on a cluster.
	Should run it quickly -- low start latency and decent performance
	Should have minimal code movement challenges
	Goal:  Distributed grep.


Version 0.2:
	Should run in wide area. Should have nontrivial scheduler + query optimizer.


FUTURE:
	Fancypants scheduling and optimization?
	Decentralized control?
	Tracking of available resources
	Approximations
