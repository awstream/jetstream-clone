This document lists libraries we plan to use or that we might use.

-------- intend to use ------


Cross-language:
	Protocol Buffers

C/C++:
	Boost (threading / asynchrony)
	


-------- might use ---


Data storage:
	Google's LevelDB. (Replaces BerkeleyDB)


-------- other libraries we'll conceivably use ----


Serialization / RPC:
	Java-specific:
		Michael Armbrust's Scala-Avro plugin and scads message passing layer is useful if we opt for Avro + Scala.

	Cross-language:
		Avro serialization is mature, RPC is less so. Apache license (Permissive).
		Thrift.  Apache license (Permissive).
		Protobufs is just serialization but more mature. BSD license.
		
Networking:
	Twitter Finagle is a network stack for asynch RPC on the JVM.  Apache license (Permissive).
	Netty is the underlying layer

Threading:
	The disruptor threading library that Storm uses.
