# Instructions:
# 1) install ansible 
# 2) add hosts you are working with to ansible_hosts file under [setup] section 
# 3) run the following:
#ansible-playbook  -i ansible_hosts_vicci bootstrap_vicci.yml -u princeton_jetstream
#
#
#
# This file takes an sns box, installs all dependencies for jetstream on it, installs and configures
# mysql, checks out jetstream, and builds jetstream. Pretty much it take an sns box to a position where
# it could run unit test.
