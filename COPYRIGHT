JetStream is confidential and proprietary software. Copyright is held by Princeton University and the authors. Use, reproduction, or distribution without prior authorization is prohibited.

NOTE: We currently use a GPLed library, the Mysql connector. As a result, it is not possible to distribute JetStream except under GPL. Our other dependencies are all permissive licenses.

In particular:

Boost is licensed under the "Boost license", which is a short non-copyleft license functionally equivalent to the MIT license.
Protobuf, Google Test, GLog: "New BSD"
